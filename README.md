# odin-recipes

This project is a simple recipes website aimed to show off what I have learned through The Odin Project. 

In this project I demonstrate the ability to use unordered lists, ordered lists, paragraphs, images, header, body, etc etc. It is worth noting that I used food that my SO and I make together and that I wanted to share with whoever may find this :)
