        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Dinner for 2</p>
        <p>This is a simple meal but one we use at our house fairly often. I like it because it's basically
            just bare necessities and it's easy to make so long as you have an oven/microwave. It usually feeds two as we split the potato between the both of us.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sweet Potato</li>

            <li>(optional) Seasonings of Your Choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees F</li>
            <li>Prick holes in your potato to let steam escape as it cooks (alternatively, cut potato into slices)</li>
            <li>When oven is ready, cook potato for 50-60 minutes</li>
            <li>Put spinach into a bowl, squeeze lemon onto spinach, then toss</li>
            <li>Towards the end of the potato's time in the oven, cook desired amount of chicken nuggets as directed by the box they came in</li>
            <li>Slice cooked nuggets in half</li>
            <li>Microwave rice & quinoa mixture as directed on package then add to bowl</li>
            <li>Slice avocado</li>
            <li>Once potato is done cooking, cut in half and add each half to a plate/bowl for serving</li>
            <li>Divvy up the spinach/rice/quinoa, chicken nuggets, and avocado amongst serving plates/bowls</li>
            <li>Add your desired seasonings and enjoy!</li>
