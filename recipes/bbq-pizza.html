        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Depending on which pizza crust you buy, it may be necessary to 'pre-cook' the crust before loading toppings, follow instructions provided by producer</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread BBQ sauce evenly across pizza crust</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the mozzarella cheese onto the pizza</li>
            <li>Add arugula to the pizza</li>
            <li>Halve or quarter the baby tomatoes and add to pizza</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 1/8 cup of the mozzarella cheese onto the pizza</li>
            <li>Cook the plant-based chicken in a skillet as directed by its packaging (we like to add some BBQ sauce in this step to add flavor)</li>
            <li>Put the chicken onto your pizza and sprinkle the rest of your cheese on top</li>
            <li>Put the pizza in the oven for about 20-25 minutes at the temperature recommended by the people that made your crust</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
